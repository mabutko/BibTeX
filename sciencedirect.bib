abstract = {Tools that automate testing of web applications for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities perform well when they have a strong knowledge base. Though, they heavily rely on brute force, which is not always an effective choice. On the other hand, expert penetration testers adopt exploit methods that are more accurate, but often not structured. We propose to solve the above mentioned problems, by designing and implementing an intelligent agent, called Suggester, that recommends actions to penetration testers. First, a black-box testing methodology inspired by a penetration tester’s behavior, is developed. Such methodology consists of sending a sequence of strings to a web application and observing the responses. Then, an agent is trained to produce attack strings using the framework of a Multiobjective Reinforcement Learning environment (MORL), with a parameterized action space. Each complete attack string is identified as a separate objective to reach. Q-Learning is used to train the agent upon separate, unrelated objectives. Then, the learned actions are suggested to a human-in-the-loop, who performs the actions and collects observations. This allows to orchestrate the agent into pursuing the right objective and selecting the next best action to recommend. The final evaluation proves the scalability of the proposed solution, as well as show an increase in accuracy when compared to other automated scanners.}

abstract = {Traceability and autonomous business logic execution are highly desirable features in IoT monitoring applications. Traceability enables verifying signals’ history for security or analytical purposes. On the other hand, the autonomous execution of pre-defined rules establishes trust between parties involved in such applications and improves the efficiency of their workflow. Smart Contracts (SCs) firmly guarantee these two requirements due to the blockchain’s immutable distributed ledger and secure cryptographic consensus rules. Thus, SCs emerged as an appealing technology for monitoring applications. However, the cost of using public blockchains to harvest these guarantees can be prohibitive, especially with the considerable fluctuation of coin prices and different use case requirements. In this paper, we introduce a general SC-based IoT monitoring framework that can leverage the security features of public blockchains while minimizing the corresponding monetary cost. The framework contains a reinforcement learning agent that adapts to users’ needs and acts in real-time to smartly set the data submission rate of IoT sensors. Results based on the Ethereum protocol show significant potential cost saving depending on users’ preferences.}

This paper proposes a novel intelligent secure control scheme, which integrates optimal control theory, zero-sum game theory, reinforcement learning and neural networks. First, the secure control problem of the compromised system is converted into the zero-sum game issue of the nominal auxiliary system, and then both policy-iteration-based and value-iteration-based adaptive dynamic programming methods are introduced to solve the Hamilton–Jacobi–Isaacs equations. The proposed secure control scheme can mitigate the effects of actuator attacks and unmatched perturbation, and stabilize the compromised cyber–physical systems by tuning the system performance parameters, which is proved through the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to the Quanser helicopter to verify the effectiveness.}

abstract = {We present the first dataset that aims to serve as a benchmark to validate the resilience of botnet detectors against adversarial attacks. This dataset includes realistic adversarial samples that are generated by leveraging two widely used Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques. These adversarial samples are proved to evade state of the art detectors based on Machine- and Deep-Learning algorithms. The initial corpus of malicious samples consists of network flows belonging to different botnet families presented in three public datasets containing real enterprise network traffic. We use these datasets to devise detectors capable of achieving state-of-the-art performance. We then train two DRL agents, based on Double Deep Q-Network and Deep Sarsa, to generate realistic adversarial samples: the goal is achieving misclassifications by performing small modifications to the initial malicious samples. These alterations involve the features that can be more realistically altered by an expert attacker, and do not compromise the underlying malicious logic of the original samples. Our dataset represents an important contribution to the cybersecurity research community as it is the first including thousands of automatically generated adversarial samples that are able to thwart state of the art classifiers with a high evasion rate. The adversarial samples are grouped by malware variant and provided in a CSV file format. Researchers can validate their defensive proposals by testing their detectors against the adversarial samples of the proposed dataset. Moreover, the analysis of these samples can pave the way to a deeper comprehension of adversarial attacks and to some sort of explainability of machine learning defensive algorithms. They can also support the definition of novel effective defensive techniques.}

abstract = {With increasing number of distributed renewable energy sources integrated in power distribution networks, network security issues such as line overloading or bus voltage violations are becoming increasingly common. Traditional capital-intensive system reinforcements could lead to overinvestment. Moreover, active network management solutions, which have emerged as important alternatives, may become a financial burden for distribution system operators or reduce profits for owners of distributed renewable energy sources, or both. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an online network reconfiguration scheme based on a deep reinforcement learning approach. In this scheme, the distribution network operator modifies the network topology to change the power flow when the reliability of network is threatened. Because the variability of distributed renewable energy is large in self-sufficient distribution networks, the reconfiguration process needs to be performed online within short time intervals, which involves the use of conventional algorithms. To solve this problem efficiently, a deep q-learning model is utilized to determine the optimal network topology. Performances of proposed and other algorithms were compared in modified CIGRE 14-bus and IEEE 123-bus test network, as well as varying penalties for frequent switching operation in consideration of physical characteristic of the network. Simulation results demonstrated that the proposed algorithm showed almost identical performances with brute-force search algorithm in both test networks, satisfying network constraints over almost all timespans. Further, the proposed method required very small computation times - under a second per each state and its scalability was verified by comparing the computation time between two test networks.}

abstract = {This article considers a preventive maintenance problem related to cyber security in universities. A Bayesian Reinforcement Learning (BRL) problem is formulated using limited data from scan results and intrusion detection system warnings. The median estimated learning time (MELT) measure is introduced to evaluate the speed at which a control system effectively eliminates parametric uncertainty and probability is concentrated on a single scenario. It is demonstrated that the Monte Carlo BRL with enhancements including Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) to generate scenarios, identical systems multi-task learning, and reward-based learning achieves shorter MELT values, i.e., “faster” learning, and improved objective values compared with alternatives in a numerical study. Rigorous results establish the optimality of the derived control strategies and the fact that optimal learning is possible under steady state assumptions. Also, the real-world case study of policies for patching Linux critical server cyber vulnerabilities generates insights including the potential to reduce expenditure per host by mandating compensating controls for critical vulnerabilities.}

abstract = {Deep learning models have opened up many prospects in medical images for achieving unprecedented performance, for example, classification of tissues and division or segmentation are a few medical outcomes. This chapter evaluates and describes the convolutional neural network (CNN) intended for characterization of tissue in clinical imaging, which is applied for segregating essential metastatic liver tumors from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging information. Advancement in the field of deep learning for normal pictures has provoked a surge of enthusiasm for applying comparative strategies to clinical images. Most of the initial attempts replaced the input of a deep CNN with medical images, which does not consider the basic contrasts between these two kinds of pictures. In particular, fine details are fundamental in clinical pictures, unlike regular images where coarse structures are very important. This distinction makes it difficult to utilize the current organized models created for common pictures, because they chip away at downscaled medical images to decrease the memory prerequisites. These subtleties are important to provide accurate detection. Furthermore, a medical test in clinical imaging regularly accompanies many perspectives, which must be intertwined to arrive at the right conclusion. A survey of deep learning is used for image classification, carotid ultrasound data investigations, cardiotocography, intravascular ultrasound reports, lung computed tomography reports, brain tumor prediction, coronavirus prediction (COVID-19) object detection, segmentation, breast cancer prediction, electrocardiogram signals, electroencephalograms, photoplethysmographic signal registration, psoriasis skin disease, as well as cancer detection. Concise summaries are delivered of trainings per application zone: pulmonary, musculoskeletal neuro, digital pathology, abdominal, retinal, breast, and cardiac. There are various types of deep learning techniques present to improve the accuracy of the medical dataset. Deep reinforcement learning, recursive neural network, multilayer perceptron, recurrent neural network, Boltzmann machine, and CNN are different types of deep learning techniques used to train the image and signal dataset. Generative adversarial network (GAN), autoencoder, and deep belief neural network are subcategories of unsupervised pretrained neural network. Some well-known architectural models of CNNs are ResNet (2015), VGGNet (2014), SqueezeNet (2016), GoogLeNet (2014), and ZFNet (2013) and are the visualization concept of the deconvolutional network; AlexNet (2012) and LeNet (Peng et al., 2009; Mitchell; Bengio, 2012; Dutkowski et al., 2015; Han et al., 2020 [[16], [17], [18], [19], [20]]) are basically used to train image datasets; the long short-term memory technique is used to train signalized datasets; and RHSBoost and genetically optimized neural network are used for efficient multiple classification of datasets. Dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, overfitting, underfitting, and normalization problems can be solved using various types of optimization algorithm. Image security is another important part, and by using an autoencoder, GAN network, and CNN we can prevent alteration in the medical image. Minor alteration of the medical image is very dangerous to patient life. By using deep learning and steganography, we can first compress as well as train the dataset, then security can be preserved after embedding of watermarks (which is a secret image visible to the human eye that cannot be altered; this steganography concept is called watermarking).}
